(Verse 1)
Down by the bay where the river runs free,
A fisherman sets out to the sea.
With a line in his hand and a hope in his heart,
He waits for the moment the fish will start.

(Chorus)
Oh, the water's so deep, and the sky is so wide,
Lost in the waves, he forgets the time.
Casting his dreams, as the sun starts to climb,
He’s caught in the rhythm of the ocean’s chime.

(Verse 2)
Morning turns to noon, and noon turns to night,
The stars in the sky are his only light.
The fish are biting, his boat starts to sway,
But he’s lost in the moment, he drifts away.

(Chorus)
Oh, the water's so deep, and the sky is so wide,
Lost in the waves, he forgets the time.
Casting his dreams, as the sun starts to climb,
He’s caught in the rhythm of the ocean’s chime.

(Bridge)
The moon whispers secrets, the tide hums a tune,
The fisherman knows he’ll be heading home soon.
But the sea’s got a magic, a spell so divine,
It steals every hour, every minute of time.

(Verse 3)
As dawn breaks anew, he looks to the shore,
His nets are full, but he wants so much more.
The world is asleep, but his heart is alive,
For in every cast, he feels the thrill of the dive.

(Chorus)
Oh, the water's so deep, and the sky is so wide,
Lost in the waves, he forgets the time.
Casting his dreams, as the sun starts to climb,
He’s caught in the rhythm of the ocean’s chime.

(Outro)
So if you see a boat drifting away,
With a fisherman lost in the sway,
Know he’s not alone, he’s right where he should be,
Lost in the wonders of the deep blue sea.
